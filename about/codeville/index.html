                        <a href="/">Codeville</a> is a platform for all the hackers and scripters around the world to publish their scripts and utilities, and eventually brag about it. At Codeville language is no bar, nor is the technology. If you have written something useful share it with the world. If you haven't written still we got something for you. You can pitch your idea here and some coder in the other side of the world will try to help you out. :) So overall it is a win-win situation for both.

                        Generally scripters, programmers or hackers, call them by any name, work in the late night hours and spend their lives almost without any fame. They day-in and day-out write utilities for them or for their friends. Codeville is a medium for these <emphasis class="bold">Dark Knights</emphasis> to brag about their scripts and utilities.
