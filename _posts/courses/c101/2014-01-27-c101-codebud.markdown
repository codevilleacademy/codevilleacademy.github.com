<h3 id="what-is-codebud">What is Codebud?</h3>
<hr class="large orange" />
<p><span class="orabge bold">Codebud</span> is your on-the-go buddy that will tell you if you solved a problem-statement well or not. Codebud is available 24 x 7, and will help you through the learning process. Following are the steps that you will follow to test your program logic.</p>

<br/>
<h3 id="steps">The steps of Codebud</h3>
<hr class="large orange" />
<span class="light-green">Step 1</span> : Download the file of inputs.<p>Input file contains some inputs for which your program should produce correct answers. Click the button
	<a class="btn btn-default" href="" role="button">Download</a>
</p>
<div class="arial italic note purple">
	<p>The Download button may or may not be present.</p>
</div><br/>
<span class="light-green">Step 2</span> : Compile the program.<p>Suppose your program name is <span class="italic">program1.c</span>; then you will compile it as</p>
{% highlight bash %}
	gcc program1.c
{% endhighlight %}
<span class="light-green">Step 3</span> : Execute the program and get the output.<br/><p>You will execute the program with the file you just downloaded like this:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
	./a.out < path_to_the_input_file > out.txt
{% endhighlight %}
<p>For example</p>
{% highlight bash %}
	./a.out < in.txt > out.txt
{% endhighlight %}

<p>But if there was no Download button for the question then follow this</li>
{% highlight bash %}
	./a.out > out.txt
{% endhighlight %}
	
<p>This step will generate the file <span class="italic">out.txt</span> which will contain the output of the program.</p>
	
<p><span class="light-green">Step 4</span> : Upload the <span class="italic">out.txt</span> you just generated.
	<a class="btn btn-default" href="" role="button">Browse the code</a>
</p>
<p><span class="light-green">Step 5</span> : Click Verify button.
	<a class="btn btn-default" href="" role="button">Verify</a>
</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="first-task">Your first task</h3>
<hr class="large orange" />

<div class="code-statement clay">
	<p class="code-question">
		Write a program that prints the statement "Hello, Codeville C101!".
	</p>
	{% include code_upload_form.html qid="c101:0" %}
</div>
<br/>
<div class="arial italic note purple">
	<p>This is very similar to the last task that you performed, which was to print on the screen "Hello, Master!". Follow the steps of the codebud mentioned above and you should be do it with ease.</p>
</div>

<table class="table table-hover">
<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Message</th>
		<th>What it means?</th>
	</tr>

<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>Accepted</td>
		<td>Your output was absolutely correct for all the inputs.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Incorrect</td>
